                                I'm a full stack engineer with <?php echo (int) date( 'Y' ) - 2008; ?> years of experience.
                                I've been developing complex web applications and leading other developers for several years.
                                <br><br>
                                My strongest abilities - according to my peers - are that I have a good eye for finding and solving bugs, as well as a great analytical and problem-solving way of thinking. This helps me see problems from a broader perspective and build great solutions to those problems.

							<h2>Republic</h2>
							<h3>Engineering Director</h3>
							<h4>2021 - Today</h4>
							<p>After NextSeed's acquisition by Republic I was transitioned to it. For strategic reasons and due to the domain knowledge that I obtained over 5+ years working for NextSeed, the stakeholders decided it would be a great idea to keep me working on a part-time basis for NextSeed and Republic.</p>
							<p>One of my first projects in Republic had a huge importance - I led a series of enhancements and bug fixes on the crypto currency integration for helping launch an offering that raised $27 million dollars in just a few hours.</p>
							<p>I interact with the VP of Engineering on a daily basis to help make key decisions about infrastructure, best practices and standards, as well as peer review code from other senior engineers.</p>

							<h2>NextSeed</h2>
							<h3>Senior Software Engineer</h3>
							<h4>2015 - Today</h4>
							<p>Full-stack web development of the NextSeed investment platform. I've been coding a wide range of complex functionalities, such as bank integrations for deposits, withdrawals, investments, payments, and so on. I've also been acting as a tech lead on the server side of the application, helping the product managers with requirements and ensuring the best practices are implemented in the code.</p>
                            <p>My current role on the team is <strong>Server Tech Lead</strong>. I'm responsible for any code that goes into the server side of the application, so I work on the most complex functionalities and review any other code that is pushed to the server repository. I also troubleshoot issues in production and assign tasks to myself and other to solve problems and create new functionalities.</p>
                            <p>Aside from coding, I've been coordinating the server team in a way it works around the clock. I assign tickets and organize the tasks in a way that there's always a server developer available (we have developers in India, US and Brazil).</p>
                            <p>On my spare time I've been taking online courses on Coursera, Udemy and A Cloud Guru, so I'm always learning new things and improving myself.</p>
